# Privacy Policy for Genius Lyrics Copier

**Last Updated:** 2025-05-25

Hi, I'm the developer of Genius Lyrics Copier. This extension is a hobby project, and I don't plan to make money from it. Your privacy is important.

## What I Don't Do

*   I **do not** collect, store, or share any of your personal data (like your IP address, browsing history, or emails).
*   I **do not** send any data from Genius.com or your clipboard to myself or any third parties.
*   I **do not** use any third-party trackers or analytics.

## How It Works & Permissions

The extension needs a few permissions to do its job:

1.  **Host Permission (`*://*.genius.com/*`):**
    *   This lets the extension read the lyrics *only* from Genius.com pages when you click the icon.
2.  **`scripting`:**
    *   This allows the extension to run a small piece of code on the Genius.com page to find the lyrics and copy them.
3.  **`clipboardWrite`:**
    *   This lets the extension put the lyrics you copied into your clipboard. It can't read what's already there.
4.  **`declarativeContent`:**
    *   This permission is used to show the extension's icon as active (clickable) in your browser bar *only* when you are on a Genius.com page. It helps you see when the extension can be used, without the extension needing to read page content before you click.

All lyric extraction and copying happen locally in your browser. Nothing is sent over the internet by this extension, except for the extension itself when it updates from the Chrome Web Store.

## Changes

If I ever update this policy, I'll change the "Last Updated" date.

## Questions?

If you have questions, please reach out via the support link on the Chrome Web Store page.
